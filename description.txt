+=== Description ===+
The Wall Busters is a mod that adds two hammers that break walls VERY FAST.

The Wall Buster Mk.I is crafted with 10 wood and 10 stone @ a workbench
The Wall Buster Mk.II is crafted with a Pwnhammer and either 1 ebonstone OR 1 crimstone @ a workbench

This mod is not balanced at all.
Im not a good artist, so if you wish to make better sprites, send me a DM and ill credit you in the description.
